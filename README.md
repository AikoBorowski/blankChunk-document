The blankChunk document is a project I started shortly after the discovery of a bug related to them. It was my goal to document how Minecraft's blankChunks can be observed and what the player can do with them so that said knowledge may be shared.
This formatted text file goes over the general idea of what a blankChunk is, the class history of EmptyChunk.java, the known issues that arose as a result and the metadata corruption; as well as a tutorial on how to trigger it.
You may use this file however you please, for educative purposes or to make your own resource, as long as credit is provided where due.
Open it in wordpad for .odt support (rip legend) or convert it to .pdf in order to use the links and files that are contained within.
